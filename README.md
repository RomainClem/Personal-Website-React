Welcome to my website repo. I've built this during the summer break after my second year at university.

I had little to no knowledge with JavaScript framework and wanted to learn the new most important thing on the market. As I needed a portfolio to find an internship. I jumped into learning React and also better understand JavaScript.

This website is far from following React best practices but I'm proud of what I was able to accomplish.

When the time arrive, I'll probably scrap everything here and experiment some other portfolio format. I don't want to become a UX / front end expert. But I would like to create something original.
